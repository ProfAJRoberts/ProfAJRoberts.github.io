<A NAME="Packages"></a> 
<h2>Packages</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBLv9IA-5jw&list=PLAvDA9VSF6oxwGHA2ELDnaSFlJvwZPT6p&index=23&t=0s">See video discussion 51</a><p>
<p>
There are packages to extend LaTeX&nbsp;in zillions of ways:
some excellent, some flaky. <em>When you want to do
something, the chances are someone has wanted to do it
before and has written a package to do it.</em> See the vast
"List of Packages" in the <a
href="https://ctan.org/pkg/catalogue">
<em>TeX Catalogue Online</em></a> (initiated by Graham
Williams). <P> Useful packages are <TT><A
HREF="ltxmaths.html#AMS">amsmath</A></TT>, <TT><A
HREF="usecolour.html">color</A></TT>, <TT><A
HREF="ltxxref.html#Hypertext">hyperref</A></TT>, <TT><A
HREF="ltxxref.html#Labels">showkeys</A></TT>, <TT><A
HREF="ltxxref.html#xrefitem">enumitem</A></TT>, <TT><A
HREF="ltxxref.html#cleveref">cleveref</A></TT>, <TT>url</TT>
and <tt><A HREF="ltxfloats.html#pgfplots">pgfplots</A></tt>. 
<P> 
If you use pdfLaTeX and have the package, then
<em>always</em> <tt>\usepackage{microtype}</tt>. The
microtype package does some fine adjustments that turns the
great typesetting of default LaTeX into near perfect
typesetting. <P>


<A NAME="Command"></a> 
<h2>Command definitions</h2>
One can define commands that extend LaTeX. For example, in
mathematics (see the <a href="ltxmaths.html"> mathematics
section</a>) we might define partial derivative commands
<PRE>\newcommand{\D}[2]
    {\frac{\partial #2}{\partial #1}}
\newcommand{\DD}[2]
    {\frac{\partial^2 #2}{\partial #1^2}}
\renewcommand{\vec}[1]{\boldsymbol{#1}}</PRE> 
The first two have two arguments, the <tt>[2]</tt>. Within a
definition, <TT>#n</TT> denotes a placeholder for the
<TT>n</TT>th supplied argument to the command. The last,
with one argument, <I>redefines</I> the <TT>\vec</TT>
command to denote vectors by boldface characters (rather
than have an arrow accent).   Then for example
<pre>\[
  \vec\nabla\times\vec q
  =\vec i\left(\D yw-\D zv\right)
  +\vec j\left(\D zu-\D xw\right)
  +\vec k\left(\D xv-\D yu\right).
\]
</pre>
more simply typesets 
\[
\newcommand{\D}[2]{\frac{\partial #2}{\partial #1}} 
\renewcommand{\vec}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}
  \vec\nabla\times\vec q
  =\vec i\left(\D yw-\D zv\right)
  +\vec j\left(\D zu-\D xw\right)
  +\vec k\left(\D xv-\D yu\right).
\]</P>

<P>Students, and markers, want the numbering of sections to
suit the exercise numbers of assignments. For example, when
an assignment is composed of Exercises 35.1, 35.2, and 42.1,
redefine the section numbering by</P>
<PRE>\renewcommand{\thesection}
    {Exercise~\ifcase\arabic{section} 
    \or35.1\or35.2\or42.1\else\fi}</PRE> 
<P>This empowers us to start each successive exercise with
simply the logical <TT>\section{}</TT>. If desired, then
include explanatory text in the exercise title with
<TT>\section{explanatory text}</TT>.</P>

<P>You will have noticed that LaTeX&nbsp;is very verbose.
Some people define their own abbreviations for the common
command structures so that they are quicker to type. <em>Do
not do this</em>; it makes your LaTeX&nbsp;much less
portable and harder to read. Instead, 
<ul><li><I>setup your editor</I> to cater for the verbosity; 
</li><li>use command definitions only to 
<ul><li>give you <I>new logical patterns</I>, such as the
partial differentiation, or
</li><li>if justifiable, redefine typeset appearance, such as
for vectors.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>





<A NAME="yourStyle"></a> 
<h2>Make your own style</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjWAdpAjhg&list=PLAvDA9VSF6oxwGHA2ELDnaSFlJvwZPT6p&index=24&t=0s">See video discussion 52</a><p>
<p>
Create a file, say <tt>mystyle.sty</tt>, and include in it
commands to change the appearance of your documents. Then
include in the preamble of all your documents
<tt>\usepackage{mystyle}</tt>. But what do you put in your
style file? Here are some suggestions.
<ul>
<li>By default use the microtype, hyperref and color packages, so include 
<pre>\usepackage{microtype,xcolor} 
\usepackage[colorlinks]{hyperref}</pre> 
<p><P> 
<li>Also we always want page headings, but the default "all
capitals" style is known to be poor, so <em>very
naughtily</em> crunch the <tt>\MakeUppercase</tt> command
<pre>\pagestyle{headings} 
\renewcommand{\MakeUppercase}[1]
  {\color{green}\textsf{#1}}</pre> 
so that the page headings now appear green and in
sans serif font (I prefer the X11 colour
OliveGreen, <a href="ltxusecol.html">see colour information</a>). <P>
<li>Say we would like the title information to always appear
in sans serif font (but <em>always remember</em> that "I
like" is dangerous). We interfere with LaTeX&nbsp;using the
<tt>\let</tt> command which defines a pointer to the
<em>current</em> definition of another command; thus
<PRE>\let\LTXmaketitle\maketitle</pre> 
defines <tt>\LTXmaketitle</tt> to point to the original
LaTeX&nbsp;definition of <tt>\maketitle</tt>. Follow this
with
<PRE>\renewcommand{\maketitle}
  {{\sf\LTXmaketitle}}</pre> 
to define a new version of <tt>\maketitle</tt> that puts it
into a sans serif font. Neat! <P>
<li>Now let us make all section headings blue. The abstract
is easy we just redefine its name
<PRE>\renewcommand{\abstractname}
  {\color{blue}Abstract}</pre> 
But to get all section headings blue we need to know (by
delving into the LaTeX system file <tt>latex.ltx</tt>
wherever it may be on your computer) that all section
headings are typeset via the command
<tt>\@startsection</tt>. Thus put into your style file the
commands
<PRE>\let\LTX@startsection\@startsection 
\renewcommand{\@startsection}[6]
  {\LTX@startsection{#1}{#2}{#3}{#4}%
  {#5}{\color{blue}\raggedright #6}} </pre> 
See that this makes the sixth argument to the original
<tt>\@startsection</tt> blue and also raggedright; the sixth
argument is the section title. 
<p>The "@" character acts
as a letter in a <tt>.sty</tt> file, but not in any
<tt>.tex</tt> file!
</ul>
<P> Download the above in <tt><a
href="mystyle.sty">mystyle.sty</a></tt> (with a few
enhancements) and try it yourself with <tt><a
href="Src/fractals32.tex">Src/fractals32.tex</a></tt>
(recall you also need the graphics <tt><a
href="Src/cantor.pdf">Src/cantor.pdf</a></tt> and <tt><a
href="Src/koch.pdf">Src/koch.pdf</a></tt>). 
<P>



<h3>Is it a style? or an extension?</h3>
The test of whether a definition should go into your style
file is determined by the answer to this question: will your
LaTeX&nbsp;document still typeset without error if your
style file is not used? 
<ul><li>if the answer is yes, then include the definition in
a <em>style</em> file (as for all of the immediate above); 
</li><li>if the answer is no (as for <tt>\D</tt> and
<tt>\DD</tt> defined earlier), then you are extending the
functionality of LaTeX&nbsp;and it is <em>not</em> suitable
for a <em>style</em> file in the true sense. Instead such
extending definitions should go into a separate
<em>definitions</em> file, say <tt>mydefns.sty</tt>. 
</li></ul>

That is, maintain two types of 'style' file:
<ul><li>
a file of <I>definitions</I> that extend the logic and
functionality of LaTeX---a file that you must share with
collaborators and journals;
</li><li>
a style file in the true sense that only affects the
appearance of resultant documents by <em>changing</em> the
way commands and environments translate logical LaTeX into
physical appearance---keep this to yourself as it only
reflects your own personal peccadilloes.
</li></ul>


<h3>Work with publisher styles and classes</h3>
Most publishers and conference proceedings have their own
LaTeX style and class files that they want/require you to use.
Almost all of them are a least a decade or so out of date.
So avoid using them until you know your submission is
accepted.
<p>
When your submission is accepted, then (supposedly) you do
have to work with the publisher's style/class file, as well
as with the advanced LaTeX you have coded.  These often
conflict.  Here I describe one example scenario.
<p>
One conflict is that most publishers define environments for
theorems and similar.  But to use <tt>cleveref</tt> you must
define such theorem-like environments <em>after</em>
<tt>\usepackage{cleveref}</tt>.  To do so you often
naughtily need to tell LaTeX to 'forget' what the publisher
has defined.  In such a scenario use <tt>\let</tt> and
<tt>\relax</tt> as in the following.  
<ul><li>In the preamble, after
using the publishers style/class file, code
<pre>\let\theorem\relax
\let\corollary\relax
...
\makeatletter\let\c@theorem\relax\makeatother</pre>
This 'undefines' theorem, corollary, ... and the counter
<tt>c@theorem</tt> by pointing them to the special 'empty'
command <tt>\relax</tt>. 
</li><li>Then continue with your
<tt>cleveref</tt> and <tt>\newtheorem</tt>s.
<pre>\usepackage[capitalise,nameinlink
    ,noabbrev]{cleveref}
\crefname{equation}{}{}
\crefname{enumi}{}{}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{corollary}[theorem]{Corollary}
...</pre>
</li></ul>
Other conflict scenarios might be handled similarly.
<p>
However, be warned that commercial publishers often simply
send accepted manuscripts to India to be completely
re-typeset afresh: that is, whatever beautiful LaTeX you
have coded and supplied is completely ignored! :(



<h3>Summary</h3>
Using packages, and making your own, is the
way to employ the hard work of many people around the
world. Remember: if you want to do something out of the
ordinary, then someone else probably has a package to do
it.




<A NAME="Seminar"></a> 
<h2>Seminar style</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVFXEl16Kc&list=PLAvDA9VSF6oxwGHA2ELDnaSFlJvwZPT6p&index=25&t=0s">See video discussion 53</a><p>
<p>
<Q>Three rules of public speaking: Be forthright. Be
brief. Be seated.</Q> (S. Dressel & J. Chew, 1987) 
</P> <P>
To prepare a document for overhead projecting, there are two
viable extremes (as well as possibilities in between):
<ul><li>
the documentclass <tt>beamer</tt> produces a visual
kaleidoscope to delight the presenter of a talk;
</li><li>
alternatively, use standard LaTeX to easily produce a clean
looking document to project for your audience.
</li></ul>
<tt>beamer</tt> is the method many people choose, <a
href="Src/beamerTemplate.tex">perhaps from this example
template</a>.
But there are two problems with beamer: 
<ul><li>you have to learn and use many new commands unique
to beamer, commands that you never use elsewhere;  and 
</li><li>the source code is so specific to beamer that you
cannot practically use the source for any other purpose
either. 
</li></ul>
If you really want to invest significant time in learning
<tt>beamer</tt>, then go for it. But I do not recommend it.
Instead, here I next describe the simpler alternative of
using standard flexible LaTeX to produce good quality clean
slides to project.
</p><p>
In either case, <em>remember that many conference venues
have flat floors and relatively low screens so that the
bottom quarter--third of every one of your slides will be
obscured for most of your audience!</em>  Be prepared:
e.g., avoid <tt>beamer</tt> styles that waste the top
quarter of a slide in `navigation'.
</p>


<h4>Alternatively use standard LaTeX</h4>
<p>Simply use the <tt>geometry</tt> package to typeset onto
landscape 'paper', which is reasonable for most modern
projectors of aspect ratio 16:9, with
<pre>\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[paperwidth=128mm
  ,paperheight=72mm,margin=7ex]{geometry}
</pre>
The above is for newer projectors: if you know you will have
an old projector, aspect ratio 4:3, then change
<tt>paperheight=96mm</tt>.
<p>
Also force some page-breaks to suit how you want to
present (I do not normally allow forcing page-breaks, but a
talk presented by you is very different to a document read
by others). Use the <tt>\newpage</tt> command where needed.
Perhaps require all sections to automatically start on a
new page with 
<pre>\let\LTXsect\section
\renewcommand{\section}{\newpage\LTXsect}</pre>
</P> <P>
Such a document is to be viewed and printed in landscape
mode, see <tt><a
href="Src/fractals33.tex">Src/fractals33.tex</a></tt>.  Of
course, one would not present this material: for a talk
supported by projection prefer summary sentences, typically
typeset in the itemize environment.
</P><P>
As always, it is good practise to: 
<ul>
<li>have less information per page, the usual rule is no more than
six lines of six words per line, the <TT>12pt</TT> option in
the documentclass helps;
<li>in the 'landscape' mode of projected slides it is often
the vertical height that is the constraint in graphics so,
if needed, then perhaps scale with
<TT>height=0.8\textheight</TT>;
<li>put citation information into a footnote on the relevant
page;
<li>the last slide is your <em>Conclusions</em>, not a
meaningless "Thank You" slide, nor a bibliography.
</ul>
</P>
