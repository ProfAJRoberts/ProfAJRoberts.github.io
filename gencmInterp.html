<h3>In the results</h3>
<div class="newspaper">
<ul>
<li>The centre manifold is parametrised by m slow variables
<tt>s(j)</tt>.
<li>Each such slow variable <tt>s(j)</tt> is either a 'real'
slow variable or a complex amplitude of an oscillatory mode
\(e^{i\omega t}\) for some frequency \(\omega\).
<li>In a real system of <small>ODE/DDE</small>s, the complex
amplitudes occur in complex conjugate pairs.
<li>I use the variable <tt>small</tt>  (also appearing as
\(\varepsilon\)) to control and order the asymptotic
expansion: introducing <tt>small</tt> into your definition
of the `nonlinear' function empowers finer control of the
asymptotics.  For example, in the delay <small>ODE</small>
example the parameter \(\delta\) is made 'small'. 
Analogously, cubic terms may best be made `small' when added
to quadratic terms.
<li>The code does cater for degenerate cases involving
generalised eigenvectors.  But the code does this by
modifying \(L\), the matrix of the linearisation at the
origin. The code attempts to make the smallest modification
it can to remove the degeneracy, and flags the change with
variable 'small' so you recover the original with
\(\verb|small|=1\). <em>Be careful</em> that the results are
relevant to what you want.
<li>Similarly, the code tries to make all, except the
nominated frequencies, of \(\vec z^*L\vec e\) to be 'small',
and also makes \(\vec f(\vec 0)\) `small'. <em>Be very
careful</em> that the results are relevant to what you want.

<li>In the case of a slow manifold, the code also computes a
basis of normal vectors to the isochrons (actually normal to
their tangent space at the slow manifold). Use these basis
vectors: 
<ul><li>to project initial conditions onto the slow
manifold; 
</li><li>to project non-autonomous forcing onto the slow
evolution;  
</li><li>to predict the consequences of modifying the
original system; and  
</li><li>in uncertainty quantification to quantify effects
on the model of uncertainties in the original system.
