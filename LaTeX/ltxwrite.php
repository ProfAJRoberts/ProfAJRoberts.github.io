<BLOCKQUOTE><small>The only proper attitude is to look upon
a successful interpretation, a correct understanding, as a
triumph against the odds. We must cease to regard a
misinterpretation as a mere unlucky accident. We must treat
it as the normal and probable event.

<h2>Write well</h2>
90%&nbsp;of research papers get less than 10 citations. Over
the period 1945--88 the most cited paper, by O.&nbsp;H.
Lowry et&nbsp;al. <EM>Protein measurement with the Folin
phenol reagent,</EM> received a staggering 187,652
citations. In contrast, 55.8%&nbsp;of papers were cited just
once, and 24.1%&nbsp;were cited 2--4 times! <P> You have to
'sell' your work and ideas. People spend time on what they
perceive will benefit them. Here I describe what I consider
to be the two main principles for organising your writing.
<P> You must structure your document so that even those who
read only a little can take away something of value---that
way they are more likely to take note of what you say and to
come back for more. Write something understandable and
useful early.<P> You must also give the reader a "map" of
what you are writing about. Introduce and summarise at all
levels in your writing.<P> 

<A NAME="Structure"></A> 
<h2>Structure your writing on a pyramid organisation</h2>
Many people will read your title; some will read the
abstract; a few will read the introduction; and only a
handful (perhaps only the referees, sigh) will struggle with
the body of your article. Give each of these readers
something to take away after they leave your article.<P> 

<DL> <DT><B>Title</B> <DD>The title is the first chance to
<em>lose</em> a reader; thus make the title interesting.
Start with a keyword. Put in a verb and make the title a
statement. Be specific. 

<DT><B>Abstract</B> <DD>The abstract is <em>not</em> a table
of contents. Instead, say what is delivered, give the
essential qualities of the paper. Use less than 50 words for
each of the following questions: 
<ul>
<li>What was done? 
<li>Why do it? 
<li>What were the results? 
<li>What do the results mean in theory and/or practise? 
<li>What is the reader's benefit? 
<li>How can the readers use this information for themselves? 
</ul>The abstract is probably all most readers read, it must
be a complete though necessarily sketchy description in
itself.<P> A wide range of people in your discipline
<I>may</I> read your abstract if you have made the title
interesting. Keep the level of jargon low, perhaps to that
appropriate to Honours degree students.<P> 

<DT><B>Introduction</B> <DD>The Introduction has to show
that your story is worth telling in detail. The Introduction
is likely to be all an interested reader reads, again it
must be complete in itself. Use a level of jargon
appropriate to say post-graduate students. Place your work
in the context of other research. Summarise your main
results, albeit in a suitably simplified form.
<P> Face it: only the dedicated diehards are going to want
to wade through the details of the rest of the paper. Give
the key results and connections in your Introduction.
<P>Sprinkle some synonyms of "novel" in order to be clear
what is new that you deliver: new, original, fresh,
innovative, innovational, inventive, modern, advanced,
avant-garde, pioneering, groundbreaking, trailblazing,
revolutionary, unprecedented, exotic.
<P> Shewchuk puts it this way <q>the introduction is the
most important part of your paper, because few of your
readers will ever read beyond it. And there's not much hope
that any of them will if you don't grab their attention from
the start. So it's a mystery why so many papers begin with
twaddle</q> 

<DT><B>The body</B> <DD>Write well. Be definite. Be
descriptive. Be precise. Cross reference. Use short
sentences.<P> Keep close together nouns and their verbs:
that is, say "the cat sat on the mat" not "the cat on the
mat sat". For another example, ``Mostly, I read the books I
review on trains.'' surely means ``Mostly, I read on trains
the books that I review.'' not that the reviewer mostly
chooses to actually read the book when he has to review one
about trains. <P> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><small> `Feedback' sometimes despairs at the way
scientists write their research papers. the prose often
seems pompous, the meaning obscure. For some reason, many
boffins don't seem to be able to resist using a long
technical word when the simple everyday equivalent would do.
We suspect the problem may start in the schoolroom. <P>
Recently, one of Feedback's colleagues asked her daughter
how her physics lessons were going at school. "I really like
physics, and I have no problems understanding it," the
daughter replied. "But I often get a bad mark for my written
work."<P> "Why?" the concerned mother asked. "Well, the
teacher doesn't like the way I write," came the reply. "For
example, last week when I was writing up an experiment, I
put down: `The object moved to one side.' The teacher said
that I should have written `The object was displaced
horizontally.' " <I>New Scientist, 10 March,
1990</I></small> </BLOCKQUOTE> 

<DT><B>Conclusion</B> <DD>Summarise your work in its
entirety. Assume readers reaching the conclusion have a
knowledge of the technicalities, having survived the body of
the text, so discuss at a more advanced level than that
possible in the Introduction. Also discuss future
possibilities.<P> </DL> 

Good examples of this style are to be found every week in
the <A HREF="http://www.newscientist.com"><EM>New
Scientist</EM></A> magazine. Look for the short pithy title
giving some essence of the main point. It is followed by a
paragraph stating the main point more precisely in a couple
of sentences. Then the body of the text gives the details.
These are the same features of writing that we all need to
employ.<P> 

<A NAME="Three"></A> 
<h2>First and last, or the rule of three</h2>
Readers give most attention to the first and last parts of
any chunk of reading. Use these first and last parts to
introduce and summarise the material, the body of your
argument, that comes in between. This leads to the rule of
three for writing: 
<ol>
<li>tell them what you will tell them; 
<li>tell them; 
<li>tell them what you have told them---but do not repeat
the introduction, instead add value by highlighting and
discussing. 
</ol>This gloriously and overly simple minded `rule of
thumb' has the correct essence. Strunk phrases the same
idea, in a more nuanced form, as <q>begin each paragraph
with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the
beginning. Again, the object is to aid the reader. The
practice here recommended enables him to discover the
purpose of each paragraph as he begins to read it, and to
retain the purpose in mind as he ends it</q> 
<P> I emphasise that this principle applies <EM>at all
levels</EM> (more-or-less). 
<ul>
<li>The first and last sentence of a paragraph must
introduce and summarise the body of argument in that
paragraph. 
<li>The first and last paragraph in a section (or
subsection) introduces and summarises the body of the
section (or subsection). 
<li>The first and last sections of a chapter introduces
and summarises the body of the chapter. 
<li>The first and last chapters introduce and summarise an
entire dissertation. 
</ul><P> Apply the following test to help beleaguered
readers. Does your document make some sort of sense: 
<ul>
<li>if you just read the first sentence in every paragraph in a section? 
<li>if you just read the first paragraph in every section? 
<li>if you just read the first section of every chapter? 
</ul>If the answer is no to any of the above, then rewrite accordingly.<P>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
A well written document is self-similar---it has much the
same design principles at all levels. 
<ul>
<li>Use a pyramid organisation with a definite and complete
description for the reader at each level. 
<li>The first and last parts of everything are the most
important. Use them to introduce and to summarise. 
<li>Read about writing from more informed sources than I. For example,
