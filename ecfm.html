<p/><p>Modern financial mathematics relies on the theory of
random processes in time, reflecting the erratic
fluctuations in financial markets.This book introduces the
fascinating area of financial mathematics and its calculus
in an accessible manner geared toward undergraduate
students. Using little high-level mathematics, the author
presents the basic methods for evaluating financial options
and building financial simulations.</p>
<h2>Errata</h2>
 
<ul>
<li>p.7, Example~1.2, third dot point: upon expanding the
square, the variance should have an extra "+2s".
<li>p.11, line~7 of item~3: "quantity the immediately"
should be "quantity we immediately"
<li>p.17, footnote: find the article <em>Stop the Subversive
Spreadsheet!</em> at <tt><a
href="http://www.eusprig.org/eusprig.pdf">http://www.eusprig.org/eusprig.pdf</a></tt> [Oct 2017].
<li>p.51, line 7: "= =" should be simply "=".
<li>p.76: line -3 and -6: "diffusion PDE 
\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\frac12\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}\)"
should be "PDE 
\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\frac12\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}=0\)"
<li>p.125: "Eifferential" should of course be "differential". 
</ul>
<h2>Extra exercises</h2>

<a href="addenda.pdf">An Addendum to the book</a> 
provides a couple of extra exercises, 
and some extra material.
