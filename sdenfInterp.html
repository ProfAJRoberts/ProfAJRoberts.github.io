<li>Each <tt>xx(i)</tt> denotes the new true slow variable
\(X_i\) where the original

original \(y_i=Y_i+(\text{modifications})\), and each

\(Z_i\) where the original
\(z_i=Z_i+(\text{modifications})\), 
<li><tt>ou(w,tt,r)</tt> denotes Ornstein--Uhlenbeck
convolution over the non-autonomous forcing/Stratonovich
process \(w(t)\) (not Ito):
<tt>ou(w,tt,r)</tt>\({}=\exp(rt)\star w(t)\) where the star
<tt>*</tt> denotes convolution which is done over the past
history of the process \(w(t)\) when \(r<0\), and done over
the future (!) of the process \(w(t)\) when \(r>0\).

Although this service is phrased in terms of Stratonovich
interpretation of noise processes, I conjecture that the
results of this service also apply to \(w(t)\) representing
Poisson processes, Levy flights, or jump processes. The
reason is that the Marcus interpretation of the calculus of
such systems "enjoys all the properties one would expect
from the Stratonovich integration rule, namely, the
conventional change of variables formula and the validity of
the coloured noise approximations" (<a
href="http://stacks.iop.org/1751-8121/47/i=34/a=342001">
Chechkin and Pavlyukevich, 2014</a>).  These rules of
calculus are what we need for the constructed coordinate
change.
