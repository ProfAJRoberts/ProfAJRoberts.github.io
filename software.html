<dl><dt><b>Equation-free Toolbox for Matlab/Octave</b></dt><dd>
<a
href="https://github.com/uoa1184615/EquationFreeGit">
Download the toolbox via Github</a> This 'equation-free
toolbox' empowers the computer-assisted analysis of complex,
multiscale systems. Its aim is to enable you to use
microscopic simulators to perform system level tasks and
analysis, because microscale simulations are often the best
available description of a system. The methodology bypasses
the derivation of macroscopic evolution equations by
computing only short bursts of of the microscale simulator,
and often only computing on small patches of the spatial
domain. This suite of functions empowers users to start
implementing such methods in their own applications.</a>

<p/></dd><dt><b>LaTeX style file for Reduce computer algebra</b></dt><dd>
From late 2011, the <a
href="http://reduce-algebra.com/">computer algebra package
Reduce</a> could input a LaTeX document with Reduce code
intermingled and Reduce would only execute the code in the
environment <tt>\begin{reduce}...\end{reduce}</tt>. Use the
reduce command <tt>in_tex "filename"$</tt>. <a
href="exampleReduce.tex">Download a LaTeX style file and an
example document.</a>

<p/></dd><dt><b>LaTeX style file to track references to labels
</b></dt><dd> At every \label, prints pages at which the
label is referenced via \ref, \eqref, \autoref,  or \cref.  One
option "disable" which omits the package, but defines the
commands that might still be in auxiliary files <a
href="LaTeX/trackRefs.sty">Download the LaTeX style file:
beta version.</a>

<p/></dd><dt><b>LaTeX style file for section contents in a
book/report</b></dt><dd> Defines \secttoc for sections in a
book.  \secttoc then lists contents of a section, one depth
deeper than minitoc does for chapters. <a
href="secttocforbook.sty">Download the LaTeX style file.</a>

<p/></dd><dt><b>Stochastic Differential Equation solver</b></dt><dd>
Supplies some stochastic differential equation (SDE) solvers
for matlab, octave and scilab.  An example of their use is
also supplied, showing the use for single and multiple
independent noise sources.  Kloeden and Platen (1992) 
comprehensively introduced the numerical solution of
SDEs. <a href="sde.dtx">Download the file sde.dtx,</a>
then execute LaTeX on sde.dtx to unpack the files.

<p/></dd><dt><b>Differential Algebraic Equation solver</b></dt><dd>
Supplies some simple differential algebraic equation (DAE) solvers
for matlab, octave and scilab.  An example of their use for a pendulum is
also supplied.   <a href="dae.dtx">Download the file dae.dtx,</a>
then execute LaTeX on dae.dtx to unpack the files.

<p/></dd><dt><b>Estimate Generalised Fractal
Dimensions</b></dt><dd> The function fdim() estimates
generalised fractal dimensions of a set of given points. 
This code is based upon traditional methods and is arguably
one of the most accurate in its class, and is reasonably
computationally efficient.  Download and unzip <a
href="fdimV0.2.zip">fdimV0.2.zip,</a> then execute
Matlab/Octave on eg.m for an example.

Centre/Slow/Invariant Manifolds</b></dt><dd> 
My repository <a
href="https://github.com/uoa1184615/WebServicesGit">
WebServicesGit</a> provides source code for using computer
algebra Reduce to construct emergent models of complex
dynamical systems.
<dl><dt>
Centre Manifold:</dt><dd> 
obtain a centre manifold of your specified
system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) or delay
differential equations (DDE), when the ODE/DDE has fast and
centre modes.  This code underlies the web service at <a
href="gencm.html">http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/gencm.html</a>
</dd><dt>
Stochastic Normal Form:</dt><dd> 
derive a stochastic/non-autonomous
coordinate transformation that separates slow, stable and
unstable modes in a system of SDEs or non-autonomous ODEs
(or autonomous ODEs).  This coordinate transform immediately
gives the reduced model on the stochastic/non-autonomous
slow manifold (and also other invariant manifolds), and the
corresponding stochastic/non-autonomous isochrons which are
so useful for projecting initial conditions and uncertainty
quantification. This code underlies the web service at <a

Estimate radius of convergence of a Taylor series
</b></dt><dd> 
This Matlab/Octave function estimates the radius of convergence
of a Taylor series from its coefficients.  The function
caters for both cases of when convergence is limited by
a single singularity or by a complex conjugate pair of
singularities.  Also estimates the location and nature of
the singularities.  <a
