<b>Linear Algebra for the 21st Century</b></a>
This textbook provides an innovative introduction and
development of the power of linear algebra in modern
science, engineering and computing.  Soon to be published by
Oxford University Press.
<!-- I make <a
href="https://github.com/uoa1184615/LinearAlgebraGit.git">
draft versions and source available on github</a> for others
to collaborate in this venture.

The <a href="LaTeX/index.html"><b>best LaTeX
introduction</b></a> shows how to transform plain text into
a beautifully typeset document in LaTeX. It introduces what
many consider are the most important fundamentals of
LaTeX2e.

Compile your own tailored version of my book to learn modern
methods of modelling complex dynamical systems.
<p>MauriÃÅcio Kritz (2019) commented in reference to the book:
<q>develops methods, techniques, and algorithms for studying
the behaviour of systems ... necessity of having simple
models, equations and mathematics as brilliantly explained
... the huge and beautiful knowledge accumulated recently
about dynamical systems. </q>

<a href="holistic1.php"><b>Holistic
discretisation</b></a> of dynamical Partial Differential
Equations obtain the spatial discretisation of one or three
coupled dynamical PDEs using dynamical systems theory.
</li><li>
<a href="sdenf.php"><b>SDE normal form</b></a> provides
you with a normal form of any supplied stochastic
differential equation (SDE), or deterministic non-autonomous
ODE or Delay ODEs, when the DEs have slow modes and fast
stable/unstable modes. The normal form decouples the slow
modes from the fast and so supplies you with a faithful
large time model of the stochastic dynamics.
</li><li>
<a href="sdesm.php"><b>SDE slow manifold</b></a>
provides you more quickly with just the slow manifold of any
supplied stochastic differential equation (SDE), or
deterministic non-autonomous ODE or Delay ODEs, when the DEs
have slow modes and fast stable/unstable modes. The slow
manifold model supplies you with a faithful large time model
of the stochastic dynamics.
</li><li>
<a href="gencm.php"><b>Find a centre manifold</b></a>
provides a centre manifold and evolution thereon of your
specified system of ordinary differential equations.  It
applies to pitchfork or Hopf bifurcations or higher order
degeneracies.  It even transforms one or coupled oscillators
into modulation equations to replace averaging and
homogenisation.
2014: added code to compute a basis of normal vectors to the
isochrons in order to model initial conditions, forcing, and
uncertainty quantification.

multifractal dimensions, are fraught with subtle
difficulties. Use this state of the art service to estimate
fractal dimensions for your 1D, 2D or 3D datasets.

<h3>Climate change?</h3>
The atmosphere is like the 'tail of the dog': it is hard to
see where the climate 'dog' is going from the 'wagging tail'
of the atmosphere's temperature.  The ocean has a heat
capacity a thousand times that of the atmosphere, and takes
hundreds of years to warm and/or cool---the ocean is like
the 'body of the dog' of climate.  So instead of looking at
atmospheric temperatures, look to the ocean to see where the
climate is going.  As the ocean warms, it expands, and so
sea level rises.  As glaciers increasingly melt, the sea
level rises.  The following graph indicates where the ocean
is going [thanks to the CSIRO at <a
